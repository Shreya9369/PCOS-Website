      <h4>Understanding PCOS</h4>
      <p>PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a common hormonal disorder that affects people with ovaries, often during their reproductive years. It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, high levels of male hormones (androgens), and the development of cysts in the ovaries. Symptoms can include irregular periods, acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), and weight gain. PCOS can also affect fertility, as it may prevent the ovaries from releasing eggs regularly. The exact cause of PCOS is not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Insulin resistance is common in people with PCOS, which can lead to increased levels of insulin and further hormone imbalances. Managing PCOS typically involves lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, along with medical treatments like hormonal contraceptives, anti-androgens, and medications to manage insulin levels.</p>

    <h2>Why PCOS Awareness Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women of reproductive age.
      It impacts <strong>1 in 10 women worldwide</strong> â€” and many remain undiagnosed for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      PCOS can cause irregular periods, acne, weight gain, excessive hair growth, and even infertility. It also increases the risk of developing conditions like <strong>type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and depression</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising awareness and providing accessible tools for early detection and lifestyle management is crucial. Our goal is to support women with PCOS by providing knowledge, resources, and a community to thrive in.
